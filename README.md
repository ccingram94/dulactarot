## INTRO

This is a Next.js (React) web application incorporating AI generated text (via GPT-3 courtesy of OpenAI) and artwork (via the Disco Diffusion Collab notebook based in turn upon the CLIP notebook of Katherine Crowson).  The database is a PostgreSQL instance hosted by Heroku.  GraphQL communicates with the native API to provide JSON data regarding the cards, their meanings, their artwork, and possible readings.  The readings were generated by querying OpenAI's GPT-3 API endpoints.
